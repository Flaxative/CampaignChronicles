# In-Play House Rules
Listed here are our applicable in-play house rules. I invite players to submit new rules as pull requests. A majority of players can pass a new rule if the GM does not object.

## Accepted Rules
- Any time a player would roll a d20, they may instead opt to roll 3d6, so long as the action they're taking is not inherently reckless. As a rule of thumb, if you've taken an option that imposes an increased penalty on failure, for example [this feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/betrayal-feats/friendly-fire-betrayal-teamwork/), then using said option would count as reckless for these purposes and require a d20 roll.
- Until the PCs gain mythic ranks, players may choose once a session to make a given d20 roll with advantage.
- GM rolls are to be pre-announced and rolled out in the open unless they are explicitly meant to be secret, e.g. opposed Stealth or Bluff rolls. If the GM does not declare what a roll is for or does not roll an applicable roll in front of players, any player may call on the GM to re-roll according to this rule.

## Proposed Rules
- None yet.
