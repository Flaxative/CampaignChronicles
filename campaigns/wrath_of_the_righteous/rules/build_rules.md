# Build rules
Characters will be built according to these sets of rules.

## Character Creation Rules
- [20 point-buy-equivalent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/)
- 150 GP starting budget.
- If a feat, spell, alternate racial trait, or any other option is [PFS-legal](https://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/additional), then it is allowed in this campaign.
Other options will be available on a discretionary basis after a discussion between the player and the GM. A fair bit of leniency will be afforded to those without heaps of PFS experience.
- Core Races are allowed. Other races need a little discussion and a GM go-ahead first, though no two players shall share a non-core race.
- Classes which provide 2 skill ranks per level instead provide 4 unless they are an Intelligence-based casting class.
- 1 trait chosen from [WotR campaign traits](https://paizo.com/products/btpy919c?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Wrath-of-the-Righteous-Players-Guide). It must be explained in a backstory, even if barebones/bullet-pointed. When a trait has specific suggestions or rules for handling multiple players with the same trait, said rules or suggestions will be followed.
- 1 additional trait for a more involved backstory that also explains how your character gained their skills and why they were in Kenabres at the start of the campaign.
- 1 final trait for a compellingly written backstory that guides your character's interactions with others and explains their motivations for eventually playing the role of crusader.
- Hobby Skill. Each level you may take a rank in one of the following if it is a class skill, or else make one of the following a class skill if is not a class skill and you have at least one rank in it.
  - Craft
  - Knowledge (Planes)
  - Knowledge (Religion)
  - Perform (Any)
  - Profession (Any)
- Mundane crafting is allowed. I won't specify further than saying some house rules making it viable will likely be needed, so you can plan a character around mundane crafting to some extent.
- Magical crafting is allowed, but don't expect to have the time to craft literally everything. As opposed to mundane crafting, some house rules will be needed to keep magical crafting from being utterly broken. Keep this in mind before planning a character around it. Notably, the [Crafting Mastery](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-heroes/mythic-paths-paizo-inc/archmage#TOC-Crafting-Mastery-Ex-) Archmage Path Ability is verboten.

## Restricted Mythic Rules
This doesn't come into play until the start of Book 2, but for players already familiar with the standard Mythic Rules (if such an add-on can be considered standard), here are the current house rules for Mythic.

Instead of using the normal mythic progression, we're using a rather restricted progression to put a cap on the power creep typical of using mythic rules. Use the standard rules as described [here](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-heroes/) with the following changes:
- You do not gain a new Path ability at each tier after the first. Instead, you may choose to replace your current Mythic Path Ability ability with a new ability for which you qualify.
- You do not gain a new Mythic Feat at each odd tier after the first. Instead, you may choose to replace your current Mythic Feat with a new one for which you qualify.
- At each even tier except the tenth, you gain a standard feat. If you have at least twice as many levels of a class with its own bonus feat feature (e.g. Ranger or Warpriest) as you do mythic tiers, this extra feat may be taken as if it were one of that class's bonus feats.
- At each odd tier after the first, you gain a number of extra skill ranks equal to your Hit Dice. These bonus ranks continue to increase with your Hit Dice as you gain levels.
- At 10th tier, you choose one additional Mythic Feat and Path Ability, for a total of two each.
