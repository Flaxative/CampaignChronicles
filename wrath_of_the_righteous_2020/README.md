# Wrath of the Righteous 2020 Interest Check

[Wrath of the Righteous](https://paizo.com/wrathOfTheRighteous) is still very much on my GMing bucket list. I don't know why, but the black-and-white good-and-evil structure of the campaign is strangely compelling to me. Comfortable, even, though maybe because I think the real potential in this sort of campaign is subverting that sort of comfort.

In my Torn Tapestry campaign, we've not had to really stretch boundaries of comfort. There have been a few gory moments, sure, and Kalgra once pondered whether murdering pursuit of magical power was worth the moral stain, but so far difficult decisions have not coincided with dire stakes in such a way as to allow a fuller exploration of the limits of morality, practicality, and more venial motives in driving character action.

Wrath of the Righteous, if I can run it well, will be a pressure cooker. As the city of Kenabres crumbles around you and its citizens, crusaders and civilians alike, fall to the demonic invasion, how will you balance mourning and necessary action? Can you sacrifice one to save many, even if that one is yourself? Would you sacrifice a thousand to save a thousand and one? As resources strain, will you continue see your fellow crusaders as valued comrades, or will they become expendable tools in service to a greater good? As your gods leave mortals to defend themselves against forces enthralled to unspeakably evil deities with no such qualms about direct intervention, will you still hew to your faiths?

Suffice to say, in running this campaign, I will aim to have far less of the wonder and tongue-in-cheek humor of the Torn Tapestry campaign. Occasional levity is important to balance out the horror, yes, but this story begins in tragedy and requires that its heroes march deep through interminable and blighted battlefields before they finally glimpse triumph dawning over the horizon.

If this non-mechanical description has you at all interested, check out the [player's guide](https://paizo.com/products/btpy919c?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Wrath-of-the-Righteous-Players-Guide) and read on.

## Subject Matter

This is not a campaign for the faint of heart, nor is it without boundaries as to what content will be presented. You can expect body horror, civilian death, violent occultism, and a general atmosphere of open, hopeless warfare. I am not myself comfortable with sexual violence, nor do I think it conducive to the atmosphere of desperation and heroic defiance I wish to create, so expect that to be a boundary in what I'm willing to describe.

That said, the point of this campaign is heroics in thee face of insurmountable odds, so know that as much as I intend to set horrible things in your way, I also intend for you to consider and process them and then bypass or solve them as is appropriate to your character.

## Players

I want three players. No fewer, no more. Four is possible if players are comfortable with the campaign progressing for a session with the absence of any one of them. I intend this to be a difficult campaign, so players should be ready both to create interesting characters and design effective builds. Even with this small party size, keeping things difficult will involve neutering the eventual mythic rules to some extent, so players should be willing to negotiate on the mythic options available.

## Schedule

I'd like to run this once or twice a week. In asking early likely players, it seems the easiest slot to work around would be a consistent weekday night, ideally Friday despite the usual social competition for that particular timeslot. As we gather the names and availability of interested players, we'll have something more solid to work with.

I'd like to explore the possibility of running this on a Virtual Tabletop like Roll20 from time to time. In-person sessions are certainly more fun, but they take a fair bit more effort to set up and schedule.

When we do run live, I will try to provide modest snacks. If we do end up running during an evening slot, I'll hope that players can manage their own dinner or chip in on something communal. 

## Build Rules
- 20 PBE
- 150 GP starting budget.
- Core Races are whitelisted. Other races need a little discussion and a GM go-ahead first.
- Classes which provide 2 skill ranks per level instead provide 4 unless they are an Intelligence-based casting class.
- 1 trait chosen from WotR campaign traits. It must be explained in a backstory, even if barebones/bullet-pointed
- 1 additional trait for a more involved backstory that also explains how your character gained their skills and why they were in Kenabres at the start of the campaign.
- 1 final trait for a compellingly written backstory that guides your character's interactions with others and explains their motivations for eventually playing the role of crusader.
- Hobby Skill. Each level you may take a rank in one of the following if it is a class skill, or else make one of the following a class skill if is not a class skill and you have at least one rank in it.
  - Craft
  - Knowledge (Planes)
  - Knowledge (Religion)
  - Perform (Any)
  - Profession (Any)
- Mundane crafting is allowed. We'll need further house-rules here, but they will boil down to some way to speed up the crafting of high-value items so they can be done in a reasonable timeframe
- Magical crafting is allowed, but don't expect to have the time to craft literally everything. There will need to be some discussion on additional house rules, but the gist will be "You need to quest for specific components instead of blowing a Spellcraft DC out of the water" to craft high-value items for which you don't meet all of the requirements.

## In-Play House Rules
- Any time a player would roll a d20, they may instead opt to roll 3d6.
- Until the PCs gain mythic ranks, players may choose once a session to make a given d20 roll with advantage.
- GM rolls are to be pre-announced and rolled out in the open unless they are explicitly meant to be secret, e.g. opposed Stealth or Bluff rolls. If the GM does not declare what a roll is for or does not roll an applicable roll in front of players, any player may call on the GM to re-roll according to this rule.

## Restricted Mythic Rules
This doesn't come into play until the start of Book 2, but for players already familiar with the standard Mythic Rules (if such an add-on can be considered standard), here are the current house rules for Mythic.

Instead of using the normal mythic progression, we're using a rather restricted progression to put a cap on the power creep typical of using mythic rules. Use the standard rules as described [here](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-heroes/) with the following changes:
- You do not gain a new Path ability at each tier after the first. Instead, you may choose to replace your current Path ability with a new ability for which you qualify.
- You do not gain a new Mythic Feat at each odd tier after the first. Instead, you may choose to replace your current Mythic Feat with a new one for which you qualify.
- At each even tier, you gain a standard feat. If you have at least twice as many levels of a class with its own bonus feat feature (e.g. Ranger or Warpriest) as you do mythic tiers, this extra feat may be taken as if it were one of that class's bonus feats.
- At each odd tier after the first, gain a number of extra skill ranks equal to your Hit Dice. As you continue to gain Hit Dice from leveling, so does this bonus increase.
- At 10th tier, you choose one additional Mythic Feat and Path Ability, for a total of two each.
