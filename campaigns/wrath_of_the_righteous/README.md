# Wrath of the Righteous 2020 Interest Check

[Wrath of the Righteous](https://paizo.com/wrathOfTheRighteous) is still very much on my GMing bucket list. I don't know why, but the black-and-white good-and-evil structure of the campaign is strangely compelling to me. Comfortable, even, though maybe because I think the real potential in this sort of campaign is subverting that sort of comfort.

In my Torn Tapestry campaign, we've not had to really stretch boundaries of comfort. There have been a few gory moments, sure, and Kalgra once pondered whether murdering pursuit of magical power was worth the moral stain, but so far difficult decisions have not coincided with dire stakes in such a way as to allow a fuller exploration of the limits of morality, practicality, and more venial motives in driving character action.

Wrath of the Righteous, if I can run it well, will be a pressure cooker. As the city of Kenabres crumbles around you and its citizens, crusaders and civilians alike, fall to the demonic invasion, how will you balance mourning and necessary action? Can you sacrifice one to save many, even if that one is yourself? Would you sacrifice a thousand to save a thousand and one? As resources strain, will you continue see your fellow crusaders as valued comrades, or will they become expendable tools in service to a greater good? As your gods leave mortals to defend themselves against forces enthralled to unspeakably evil deities with no such qualms about direct intervention, will you still hew to your faiths?

Suffice to say, in running this campaign, I will aim to have far less of the wonder and tongue-in-cheek humor of the Torn Tapestry campaign. Occasional levity is important to balance out the horror, yes, but this story begins in tragedy and requires that its heroes march deep through interminable and blighted battlefields before they finally glimpse triumph dawning over the horizon.

If this non-mechanical description has you at all interested, check out the [player's guide](https://paizo.com/products/btpy919c?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Wrath-of-the-Righteous-Players-Guide) and read on.

## Subject Matter

This is not a campaign for the faint of heart, nor is it without boundaries as to what content will be presented. You can expect body horror, civilian death, violent occultism, and a general atmosphere of open, hopeless warfare. I am not myself comfortable with sexual violence, nor do I think it conducive to the atmosphere of desperation and heroic defiance I wish to create, so expect that to be a boundary in what I'm willing to describe.

That said, the point of this campaign is heroics in thee face of insurmountable odds, so know that as much as I intend to set horrible things in your way, I also intend for you to consider and process them and then bypass or solve them as is appropriate to your character.

## Players

I want three players, maybe four. I intend this to be a difficult campaign, so players should be ready both to create interesting characters and design effective builds. Even with this small party size, keeping things difficult will involve neutering the eventual mythic rules to some extent, so players should be willing to negotiate on the mythic options available when they become available in the second book.

## Schedule

Because of recent events, i.e. our new reality of social distancing, this is now destined to be an online-only campaign. We will be running this campaign on [Roll20](https://roll20.net/), and for the most part the campaign will run as a play-by-post. Rule of thumb is one turn/interaction a day. In combat, if a player has not acted within a day of their turn coming up, they'll be assumed to be delaying. Out of combat, they'll be assumed to be going with the party's current decisions if they don't respond in a day.

When possible, maybe once or twice a month, I'd like to do synchronous remote sessions, probably on the weekend if I'm being honest, as a majority of the current participants work odd hours at the same company.

Online play, whether run live over Roll20 with voice chat or asynchronously post-by-post, will require us to adopt certain conventions that will be laid out in a separate Play Rules document.
