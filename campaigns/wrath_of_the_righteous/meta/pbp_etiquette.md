# Play-By-Post Etiquette
Here are a few guidelines for effective Play-By-Post. Feel free to suggest additional rules in a pull request.

## Rule 0: Conservation of Momentum
Our most valuable commodity is momentum. It is also our most easily squandered. We don't have the force of a social gathering and all the attendant banter and merriment to drive our engagement in the campaign. Be mindful of how your in-game or out-of-character actions drive the action forward. This guiding principle will be elaborated upon in further rules.

## Rule 1: Go "yes, and" yourself.
Don't let strict adherence to the rules hold you back. If you think something should work, and if you can concoct some mechanical way to make it happen, just go with it. We do not have the luxury of negotiating your options before you take them like we would at a live table. For example, let's say you want to swing from a rope to flank a baddy and then attack. I might not have said there was a rope there, but if you see its inclusion as reasonable, then so be it. Maybe there's not a ready-made DC for your act of heroics, so please concoct one. Then do it. I'll only naysay such creativity if it feels egregious in a "you know it when you see it" sort of way. Else, the action stands as your rolls dictate, and at most I'll say "cool, but that won't fly next time" and we'll have precedent going forward.

## Rule 2: Contrarianism is an anti-pattern
Always ask if an argument is worth the disruption of play before having it. This applies for rules quibbles, in-character disputes, and so forth. If a judgment is unlikely to drastically alter your character's fate, just go with it. If an in-character argument with another player is not likely to drive any sort of character or story development, please drop it. Go with the flow when possible.

## Rule 3: Provide a script.
In a PBP format, it's hard to handle off-turn actions. It bogs things down if something happens after your turn that you could interrupt and only choose to do so a day later after half the participants have acted and you've taken another look at the thread. Everybody starts with such capabilities, even if they're just attacks of opportunity. Everybody will definitely eventually have the ability to boost save results or other rolls if they fail. It's all but necessary to provide programming for how you'd use such abilities. Some examples follow:
- If an enemy provokes with spellcasting, I attack normally with my attack of opportunity, but if an enemy provokes by moving through my threatened area, I try to trip instead.
- If I fail a will save, I boost it with one use of mythic power.
- If I could feasibly spoil a full attack by moving five feet, I'll use Swashbuckler's Dodge to do so.

You can also provide a script as to what your character does when they'd otherwise be delayed because you've not been posting.

This applies to a lesser extent to actions out of initiative. What is the party's standard marching order? What do they do at doors? How do they search a room? It really helps if the GM can roll these all at once instead of spending basically an entire day waiting for PCs to do the same.

## Rule 4: Descriptive > "Correct".
You can tiptoe into the poetic in describing your action, or you can write only enough beyond the roll macros to get your point across. You can spel gud, or you can spell well. As long as you are explicit enough in description that the other players and GM are clear as to what your character is doing, no one has reason to complain.

## Rule 5: Stay regular
Try to post something every day, even if it's just to note that your character is not responding to the current situation. Let everyone know you're up to date on what's going on, at least. This becomes a bit more critical in combat, where your inaction can have deleterious effects for your comrades.
